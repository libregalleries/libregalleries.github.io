Customs License for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use

This a customs license made by the author of this project, due to uncertainty
and lack of regulation in current developments on artificial intelligence (AI)
model languages to create or modify from existing sources of visuals or texts
alike.

With it, I'll give my statement, I DO NOT allow all of the content in this project
in used for artificial intelligence (AI) training data for any goal, BUT I do give
an option for any developer who is interested in using any content on this project
to negotiate or even buy the content by asking directly the owner who holds
the right of the content.

This license is written by a non-professional in a law firm or does not provide
legal services and legal advice, but I created by a passionate Artist about his
work, and can be changed based on developments of regulations on artificial
intelligence (AI) or rewritten for an improved license.
